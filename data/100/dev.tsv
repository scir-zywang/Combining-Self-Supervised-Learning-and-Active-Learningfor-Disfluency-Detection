242	and also this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing this kind of big brother activity	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D D O O O O O O
243	and yet a lot of these large corporations such as texas instruments although they do n't admit to it it 's actually a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
244	so what that means is to me that really it 's the government that 's requiring this	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
245	although they do n't actually execute it themselves it 's really the government that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
246	so in that sense it at least philosophically it 's really borderline legal	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O O O O O O
247	i i think the i think that a person 's competence should be more determined by their actions and their behavior	NONE	NONE	D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
248	and if they 're if they 're on some kind of controlled substance then it kinds of takes away from the job of the supervisor or manager type person who is able to evaluate them	NONE	NONE	O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
249	i think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a a chemical	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O D O O
250	what about this aids epidemic where you find that certain people are actually are are criminal in their disregard for others	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O D O D O O O O O O O
251	these people that are carriers and do n't that do n't reveal it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D D O O O O O
252	and and of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it does n't	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
253	it it destroys their libido	NONE	NONE	D O O O O
254	that would be kind of an extreme	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
255	if they ever	NONE	NONE	O O O
256	i 've heard of things like making them marking them somehow or or something like that or putting them all someplace like in a kind of	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D D O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
257	so what about that as an invasion of privacy	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
258	i guess it kind of borders on where what do you value more the invasion of the person 's privacy or the possible danger to other people	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
259	it gets to balancing personal freedom against the general welfare of society	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
260	i guess that 's that 's been the big role of government i generally	NONE	NONE	O O D D O O O O O O O O O O
261	it it 's supposed to have been	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O
262	that 's kind of a difficult one to go into	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
263	i mean that that particular case	NONE	NONE	O O D O O O
264	because there 's a lot of people that they could require obligatory aids testing for everyone because i 'm there 's a huge part of the population	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O
265	not a huge part but a	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
266	a growing part	NONE	NONE	O O O
267	the aids population i that have it that do n't know they do are spreading it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
268	but again to require such a test and and then to make make it is to subject them to to discriminatory practices and other things	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O D O O O D O O O O O O D O O O O O O
269	i do n't know	NONE	NONE	O O O O
270	i do n't know how exactly i feel about that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
271	maybe chop their weenies off	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
272	go ahead	NONE	NONE	O O
273	i think public service is a worthy thing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
274	and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs such as peace corps that promote that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
275	probably the most popular one but one that is not typically recognized as such is the boy scouts	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
276	i know that because my son is a a scout now and is thinking about his eagle	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O
277	and in order to get eagle you have to have merit badges in citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
278	and you have to do a public service project in which leadership is the key element	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
279	i i think the question is posed somewhat strangely because it 's talking about a requirement for public service	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
280	and of course the peace corps the boy scouts is a is a voluntary activity	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O
281	i i think that might be talking referring to something kind of alternative to the draft	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O
282	either you have military service or some sort of alternative nonmilitary service for a few years	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
283	of course military service falls under the category of a public service	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
284	and so one of the things that would fulfill the at least the nominal qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
285	but i agree with you that probably is not what was comprehended	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
286	there are other things such as civil service which many people are lifelong employees of	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
287	but i suspect that was not what they had in mind either	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
288	more of a voluntary kind of thing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
289	for for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative public service for young people to go into after high school	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
290	kind of in lieu of the draft for for people who do n't who are conscientious objectors or do n't otherwise want to be in the military	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O D O O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
291	say you can go into the military	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
292	or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and and learn about things	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O
293	and it 's interesting because i i 'm not a particular fan of the military	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O
294	but i have seen a lot of people a lot of young guys go in that do n't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and are n't terribly disciplined even just personal discipline about what they want to do	NONE	NONE	O O O O D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
295	and they come out	NONE	NONE	O O O O
296	and they they at least have now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline	NONE	NONE	O D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O
297	and they have in in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can say they can see that if i do something or submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever at least for a short period of time i can accomplish a lot	NONE	NONE	O D D D O O O O O O O O O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
298	and it it 's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn that they do n't need to be cowboys	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
299	they do n't need to be out there and constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O
300	and for some for some young men that 's good	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O
301	for me it would have been lousy idea because i i did have the personal discipline	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O
302	and i went to college for four years and got out	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
303	why is that	NONE	NONE	O O O
304	so but for some people that 's good	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O
305	i i do n't particular like the fact that it 's the military	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O
306	and the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially as as an instrument of u s policy	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O
307	it 's to defend the nation against external evils	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
308	that 's one view	NONE	NONE	O O O O
309	and and and that that 's another debate	NONE	NONE	D D O D O O O O
310	but it 's	NONE	NONE	O O O
311	it depends on whether you whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive aggression oriented military	NONE	NONE	O O O D D O O O D D D O O O O O O O O O D O O O
312	and it 's it it seems pretty aggressive oriented	NONE	NONE	O D D D O O O O O
313	you you look at the last military action which was in the persian gulf and was n't anywhere near the united states	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
314	and it was it was definitely a projection of u s power on the other side of the globe	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
315	so at at any rate this is getting off the topic	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O
316	my my point was that there is for people who do n't want to do the military service there it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and sense of community that the boy scouts	NONE	NONE	D O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

323	somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O

348	because they were just	NONE	NONE	O O O O
349	it 's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
350	and then the houses were left unguarded but	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
351	i think given that people are pretty conscientious about it that 's a good way to to work it with a neighborhood watch	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O
352	also i 've heard that the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they 're home like on the weekends	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
353	is that right	NONE	NONE	O O O
354	a high percentage of free time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
355	i think it 's like fifty percent of most people 's free time is spent doing yard work outdoors	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
356	so they wait while you 're out outdoors	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O

387	when i was getting robbed down in florida i was really considering electrifying doors things like that like	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

393	it is n't	NONE	NONE	O O O
394	there was a there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

440	by the way when you say most people think it is i think it 's like ninety-nine point ninety-nine think it is percent	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
441	i do n't think it 's that high	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
442	you do n't	NONE	NONE	O O O
443	i know a lot of people who may watch the t v news in the evening but do n't spend the time to actually read a newspaper	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
444	and i think they 're saying if something 's really important i 'll at least find out that it happened	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
445	and and that 's a that 's is a reasonable start	NONE	NONE	D O D D D O O O O O O
446	and for awhile i did n't read a newspaper when i came out here because i did n't find one that i liked	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
447	and if something important happened it was covered on t v	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
448	and i could then go and and pick up newspapers if if it were important enough to read about	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D O O O O D O O O O O O O O
449	and i imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened you 'd find out from friends or other channels	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
450	i did on the the supreme court hearings the for the whole business of	NONE	NONE	O O O D O O O O D O O O O O

457	and when i arrived at her house she was engrossed in that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
458	we ended up watching it for a couple of hours zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and watching it some more	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
459	and i thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

461	i stayed as far away from those as i could	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
462	i decided i did n't want to waste the time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
463	i had i five years ago now wasted that kind of time with oliver north hearings and afterwards decided that what i had gotten out of it just was n't worth the time i put in and that these things are just very slow in seeing information come out	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
464	do you ever read	NONE	NONE	O O O O
465	i say they	NONE	NONE	O O O
466	probably the best things to do is is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O
467	if they sink they 're innocent	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O

470	how do you how do you feel	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O
471	that 's of course being facetious	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
472	you 'd have to say that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
473	i do n't know	NONE	NONE	O O O O
474	the the things they asked to talk about were whether the whether the judge should be the one that does the sentencing	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O
475	and seems to me that that 's i think that 's the way it 's done now	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O
476	at least my understanding of the law which is n't very good	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
477	it seems to me that the judge does it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
478	and i i think that 's probably all right in that they maybe know what the the norm is for a particular thing	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O
479	and i guess also what the system will absorb	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
480	probably more tuned in to that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
481	possibly though on capital cases like maybe the death penalty	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
482	i 'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
483	he could have a personal prejudice	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
484	judges are people like everybody else even though they 're they 're supposed to be impartial	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O
485	that 's right	NONE	NONE	O O O
486	but maybe	NONE	NONE	O O
487	and i think that may i that may be an exception as well	NONE	NONE	O O O D D D O O O O O O O
488	because i think that	NONE	NONE	O O O O
489	does n't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than than the judge	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D O O O
490	i i think that 's i think that 's the way it is	NONE	NONE	D D D D D O O O O O O O O
491	whether they they decide whether or not they the accused or whatever would get the get the death penalty	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O D O O O O O D D O O O O
492	do they have a death penalty in california	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
493	in fact they 're going to execute somebody at the end of this month	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
494	and there 's a big uproar going on right now	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
495	the governor has been trying to decide whether he 's going to commute it or not	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
496	it 's someone who had killed two teenage boys here in san diego as a matter of fact	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
497	something like that i 've got no problem with it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
498	i guess the way i think about it is not it should n't necessarily be thought of as revenge	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O
499	it 's just like if you 've got a dog that 's running wild and biting people	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
500	put it to sleep	NONE	NONE	O O O O
501	just get it out	NONE	NONE	O O O O
502	it 's not able to fit in	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
503	something inexpensive	NONE	NONE	O O
504	i guess kind of the way i think about it also is they just	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
505	if somebody gets the death penalty they 're they 're judged guilty	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D D O O O O
506	they got the death penalty	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
507	they should have one year and one appeal cover all their bases with one appeal	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
508	and if not do n't do n't let them sit up there on death row for fifteen years	NONE	NONE	O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
509	i think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
510	but i guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
511	and you 'd hate to be one of those	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
512	i 'm sure	NONE	NONE	O O O
513	the other thing they asked about was whether the verdict should be required to be unanimous which again i think is the way it is now that all the all verdicts	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O
514	maybe not	NONE	NONE	O O
515	i do n't know	NONE	NONE	O O O O
516	at least in capital cases i 'd think they 'd have to be unanimous	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
517	i believe it is in capital	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
518	i think in lesser cases it 's ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever how ever many is on sitting on a jury	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O
519	i i believe that 's the way it is	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O
520	but i 'm pretty sure you 're correct on capital cases	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
521	the paper here tonight had a thing about the noriega trial and that there 's one juror that is is different than the other eleven	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O
522	and they 've only deliberated four hours or something	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
523	and they say they 're hopelessly deadlocked	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
524	and the judge told them they were n't hopelessly deadlocked yet	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
525	i 'm telling you go one way or the other	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
526	that that 's probably an expensive trial	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O
527	six months so far they said	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
528	i 'm not sure there 's a number	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
529	it 's probably thirty forty thousand dollars a day worth of all the free for all	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
530	maybe they could go with a with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their vote	NONE	NONE	O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
531	that 's that 's been so long i 've practically forgot who noriega was	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O O O O O O
532	that has been going on	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
533	my cousin is a f b i agent down in miami	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O

535	that 's interesting	NONE	NONE	O O O
536	she 's not involved in that that case	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D O O

543	i got called	NONE	NONE	O O O

548	have you every been tested for a new job or anything	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O

551	this is the rules that they can do this anytime	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
552	i do n't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
553	so it 's just sort of	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
554	they can if they	NONE	NONE	O O O O
555	they can if they choose to	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
556	have you have you had any experience with it at all	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O O O
557	not really	NONE	NONE	O O
558	but i 've always worked on a university level	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
559	but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
560	so what do you think about that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
561	i do n't i do n't think they 're very accurate	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O
562	because i know their lifestyles changed prior to the drug test	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
563	and i know they changed afterwards	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
564	i know of that too	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
565	and i also know that things like antihistamines sudafeds things like that can really throw it off	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
566	and you can not get a job because of it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
567	and they may not tell you the reason why	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
568	i i had a friend	NONE	NONE	D O O O O
569	it did n't cause her any problems with her job	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
570	but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
571	but what it was was she had been she had been in the jungle	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D D D O O O O O O
572	and it was some malaria medication	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
573	and she tested positive for that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
574	and so it really is a dangerous thing that way	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
575	because i know of somebody that tested for an airline and did n't get the job	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
576	and they were n't told why	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
577	but a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
578	or they would tell you	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
579	or this person never use any drugs	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
580	i always	NONE	NONE	O O
581	i thought they got you got called back if you tested positive for more tests	NONE	NONE	O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O
582	you should	NONE	NONE	O O
583	because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
584	i have real mixed feelings about it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
585	i do n't know	NONE	NONE	O O O O
586	how do you know how wrong they are	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O
587	are they is there a margin of error	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O
588	the accuracy	NONE	NONE	O O
589	i do n't know	NONE	NONE	O O O O
590	i do n't know	NONE	NONE	O O O O
591	but i know there are a lot of things that can influence them	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
592	and i think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
593	and if you could show that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
594	i i interviewed for a job recently	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O
595	and i was taking entex and my doctor gave me a prescription for it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
596	and he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
597	and it did n't come up that i needed to do it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
598	but this could happen to anybody	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
599	and if they would just say this person 's drug test is positive we wo n't hire them then you could lose out on a job when really you did n't do anything	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
600	so i do n't know	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
601	and i i 'm not so sure they are that needed	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O
602	i 'm not sure either	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
603	the only way i can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it then they have the right to go ahead and prove it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
604	because they say they can spot check	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
605	if you 're using it while at a job i can see a problem	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
606	but the occasional person then it 's almost it 's almost an infringement of your privacy	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D D D O O O O O O O O
607	it sort of is	NONE	NONE	O O O O
608	and this is it	NONE	NONE	O O O O
609	i 'm not real sure how i feel about it because i can see it from two ways	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
610	as a health professional i would n't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
611	so as a patient i feel we probably should be protected	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
612	but on the other hand there 's a lot of things i should be protected from that they do n't test my patients for too	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
613	so i guess you sort of you have to have trust some place along the way	NONE	NONE	O O O D D D O O O O O O O O O O
614	you ca n't go around testing everybody for everything	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
615	so i do n't know	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
616	and i i think it could be used to hassle somebody	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O
617	if someone was out to get you i think that a company or a boss could use this	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
618	they could keep on doing this to you or something i guess	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
619	i can see where it could become a problem	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
620	and it it 's like it seems like now they have tests	NONE	NONE	O D D D D O O O O O O O
621	i guess they can test your hair	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
622	and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
623	but maybe you should n't be held responsible for something you did several years ago	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
624	i know	NONE	NONE	O O
625	that 's the other thing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
626	a lot of a lot of people as kids or young people get into some things that they get out of later on	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
627	and i do n't think they should really have to pay for that forever	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
628	there 's a lot of things you do as a kid that you would n't do as an adult	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
629	but you ca n't say it was wrong at the time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
630	i think that 's true	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
631	so that probably would n't be too good either	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
632	we 're our discussion 's about the care of the elderly	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O O O
633	that 's right	NONE	NONE	O O O
634	that 's right	NONE	NONE	O O O
635	what what what do you think is important	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O
636	if you were	NONE	NONE	O O O
637	i do n't know how how old you are	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O O
638	but if you had if you had parents or or or grandparents whatever it is who were ready who who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for	NONE	NONE	O D D D O O O O D D O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
639	i actually my dad 's my dad 's almost ninety	NONE	NONE	D D D D D O O O O O
640	and he lives by himself	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
641	and he 's in good shape	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
642	but some friends of mine have gone through this	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
643	i think i 'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and where they did some things to try to keep them mentally alive and where there was caring and compassionate where there were caring and compassionate people operating it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D D D D O O O O O O O O O
644	do you have any experience with this yourself	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O

646	and we go there once a year	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
647	we see we tend to see her there cause we 're in boston	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O O O O O
648	so we 're pretty far away	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
649	when we visit minnesota though we go to see her	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
650	and it seems	NONE	NONE	O O O
651	the the environment there i do n't know too much about it	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O
652	but it it seems nice enough	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O
653	it it 's hard	NONE	NONE	D O O O
654	at least half of the residents i would are not not mentally sound	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O D O O O
655	so it 's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to to retain clarity	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O
656	from the lack of stimulation you mean	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
657	i i i do n't know	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O
658	we we also my wife and i volunteer to go to a nursing home that 's just a mile from our house	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

660	we used to go once a month once every two months to visit some of the patients there	NONE	NONE	O O O O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O

663	and there i would say it 's the same thing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
664	it 's it 's a nice relatively nice environment	NONE	NONE	D D O O O D O O O
665	but again it must be depressing for the people who who are who are just essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but but certainly certainly have are have retained all of their mental skills and so on	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O D O D D O O O O O O O O O O
666	it 's must be depressing to to walk walk the halls and see and see all these other people who really do n't know where they are	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D O D O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

674	it it 's possible	NONE	NONE	D O O O
675	i was thinking also that there 'd be there could be a fair burn out factor in just having to respond to people 's needs where the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

726	the best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
727	and when the envelope was empty then you did n't have any more money to spend in that area	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
728	and that worked out real well cause we did n't have to keep writing down what we 'd spent	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
729	it was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
730	and we did that pretty successfully for about three months	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
731	and then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
732	and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
733	i had a part-time job around fifteen years ago seventy-six	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O

735	and so i was willing to take a half time job to do that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
736	and i actually did	NONE	NONE	O O O O
737	my bank account would	NONE	NONE	O O O O
738	i 'd i i kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O O
739	but i i had miscalculated	NONE	NONE	O D O O O
740	i i did n't keep a balance	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O
741	it 's one of the problems	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
742	i never had to in the past	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
743	i always kept plenty of money in my checking account	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
744	but when you 're only earning half the salary even though i was n't spending much money i sometimes i sometimes would just	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O
745	things would get to tight	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
746	and sometimes what i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
747	and every time i i spent money cash mostly i would write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent on food so i could do better planning	NONE	NONE	O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
748	but i would forget to write the things down	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
749	and it that i i do n't know if i ever went as far as three months or not in keeping that kind of data	NONE	NONE	O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
750	i certainly have n't done that in sixteen years or whatever	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
751	i even find now with the automatic tellers i 'll go take money out of that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
752	and then i forget to take that out of my checking account	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
753	so i i i leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and i figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what 's really there	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
754	and i figure that gives me room for the mistakes i make	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
755	i i have to say that	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O
756	let 's see at this point on i do n't run out of money	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
757	and it	NONE	NONE	O O
758	and i do n't	NONE	NONE	O O O O
759	someday if i were to get remarried i might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which i do n't have	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
760	and i i i think my strategy if if i may is to is to not spend money	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O D O O O D D O O O O O
761	i do n't have expensive tastes	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
762	i do n't go out	NONE	NONE	O O O O O

770	my my mechanics loved it because it was an old it was a sixty-five buick	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O D D D D O O O O O
771	and it just would n't stop	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
772	and it	NONE	NONE	O O
773	i i just did n't feel the need for a new car	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O
774	it is n't like i could n't afford one	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
775	and now i i do n't	NONE	NONE	O O D O O O
776	i tend to eat expensive food	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
777	i do n't mind buying a good steak	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
778	but for me i only do that every week or without even maybe once a month	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O
779	you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous twelve dollars a pound	NONE	NONE	O O D O O O O O O O O O O
780	you buy a a less than half a pound so it 's six or seven dollars	NONE	NONE	O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
781	to me i realize if you have eight kids you 're not going to run out and do that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
782	not very often	NONE	NONE	O O O
783	but but i 'm just i 'm just saying as a single person that 's that 's a drop in the bucket	NONE	NONE	D O D D D O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O
784	and so if you 're extravagant on how you buy food it does n't add up if you 're buying if you 're not going to super expensive restaurants which i do n't care to go to	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
785	that 's right	NONE	NONE	O O O
786	so so that 's i one of the reasons i do n't need to budget is that i do n't have i do n't i do n't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because i ca n't afford it because i 'm not interested in that expensive thing	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

790	i work for georgia tech	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
791	i work for the research facility	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
792	and it 's it 's kind of small in a sense	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O O
793	but it it does have about i two thousand civil employees	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O
794	and on a a scale i guess it 's still considered small	NONE	NONE	O O D O O O O O O O O O
795	it just have a lot of different laboratories	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
796	the area i work in it it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O
797	so that 's make up most of the laboratory	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
798	so from from that standpoint it 's pretty small it 's pretty small	NONE	NONE	O D O O O D D D D O O O O
799	what about yourself	NONE	NONE	O O O
800	i i work for actually probably similar kind of place	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O

804	so we 're we 're part we 're actually part of m i t	NONE	NONE	O D D D D D O O O O O O O O
805	so it 's very much the same kind of place and the technical institution	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D O O O
806	while i was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of what what things were important besides salary and a and a job i list i had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the the challenge of the work and the working conditions things like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O
807	i do n't know	NONE	NONE	O O O O
808	what are your what sorts of things would you consider important	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O
809	those and probably the security aspect of it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
810	because a lot of time nowadays even though you 're working you 're treated	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
811	and it may not be true in every place	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
812	in a lot of cases i think you 're treated more like a number instead of a a person	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O
813	because when it come down to layoff they do n't really consider people and and their well being as far as how they going their next dollar going to come in how they going to pay their bills	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
814	they just lay them off	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
815	and i was reading this book one time about this guy that had	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
816	i think the company still exists	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
817	what they use to do is they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
818	that way that one person would n't get one big blunt blow at one time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
819	and i think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better other than something like	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
820	unemployment is good	NONE	NONE	O O O
821	but the company as a whole	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
822	because you as an employee even the company is making money	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
823	they paying you a salary	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
824	but you are responsible for that company growth	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
825	you 're responsible also for helping that company get to the point that it 's at at making profits	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
826	so there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than neglect or something like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
827	because it 's not a person 's fault that people not buying or businesses are are not on the up and up all the time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O
828	i do n't see how one or two people maybe more one or two but a number of people can can be the downfall of a company situation	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O
829	how do you mean that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
830	i know it	NONE	NONE	O O O
831	in a sense that how do you make a a conclusion that you 're going to lay off these ten people for the bad times of the company	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
832	what about the the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well	NONE	NONE	O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
833	in that standpoint	NONE	NONE	O O O
834	you you think it 's better than to to try to spread the the effort equally among all the employees of the company	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O D O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O
835	i do	NONE	NONE	O O
836	i really do	NONE	NONE	O O O
837	i think it 'd be better that way	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
838	and even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that that there are problems	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O
839	and there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
840	that 's just that 's my views	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O
841	i 've heard of a couple of companies that have done that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
842	i think back about a few years ago when things were tough hewlett-packard did that for awhile	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
843	they went to a a a four and a half day work week rather than cut just cut everybody back ten percent and have to give everybody a half day a week off	NONE	NONE	O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
844	and i think you can do that for a little while	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
845	but i 'm	NONE	NONE	O O O
846	at least that would give a person a chance to look because the way it is a person really do n't have a chance	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

895	if you have one child or fewer you get involved in organized events or activities	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

910	she had to go with me	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
911	so the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and and competing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O
912	and of course the competing itself really did n't matter what it was	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
913	it was making the friends and going all the places	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O

952	i 'm surprised to hear that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O

954	i try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
955	actually that is really a sore spot with me	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
956	i i think perhaps the automotive industry is improving	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O
957	but ten years ago reliability of automobiles at least u s automobiles was pretty dismal	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
958	and not only that but the repair capability of service departments and dealerships was equally dismal	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
959	and it seemed that the only way i could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
960	but i	NONE	NONE	O O
961	so do you have a car	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
962	do you have a car	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
963	at that time actually i had a volkswagen rabbit	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
964	and it was it was a real lemon	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O
965	subsequently i got a buick century	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
966	and it was n't as bad	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
967	but last year i bought a honda accord	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
968	and i take it in once every seventy-five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
969	and that is it	NONE	NONE	O O O O
970	and it 's wonderful	NONE	NONE	O O O O
971	we used to have a honda accord	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
972	and they 're good	NONE	NONE	O O O O
973	they 're really good cars	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
974	every time i get taken to an auto repair place every time i go i get taken	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
975	woman goes in	NONE	NONE	O O O
976	and they go we got a sucker	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
977	let 's see how much money we can get out of her	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
978	that 's what happens every time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
979	what do you have	NONE	NONE	O O O O
980	i have a pontiac six thousand	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
981	all the more reason to have a a honda	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O
982	but our honda just got old and just wore out	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
983	it was 's see eleven years old	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
984	and it just just out of it	NONE	NONE	O O D O O O O
985	so you bought a pontiac	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
986	my ex-husband 's	NONE	NONE	O O O
987	this is just happened a couple of weeks ago	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O
988	he 's my ex-husband	NONE	NONE	O O O O
989	but just a few months ago when he was my husband his father gave us this car	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
990	and everything is wrong with it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
991	the power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
992	how old is the car	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
993	and he just does n't take care of things	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
994	and but i was awarded the car	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O
995	so there is a man in my church that is a mechanic	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
996	and i can trust him	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
997	so he is trying to get things fixed on it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
998	but it 's just leak leak leak everywhere	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
999	but i hate to go into a a repair place because they 'll tell me something is wrong with it and it 's not and charge me twice as much	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1000	the last time i took it into a repair shop the man told me i needed a master cylinder	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1001	so i said	NONE	NONE	O O O
1002	and he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
1003	and then about a month later a man was looking at my car	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1004	and he asked me not a man not a repair man but just a friend	NONE	NONE	O O O O D D D O O O O O O O O
1005	and i was telling him that i just a new master cylinder put on	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1006	and he looked at	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1007	and he said that 's not a new master cylinder	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
1008	and i did n't even know what one was	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
1009	and he showed it to me	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1010	and it was old rusty just awful	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1011	it was no more new than nothing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1012	so apparently it was the same one that was on there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
1013	more than likely	NONE	NONE	O O O
1014	apparently just probably filled the the brake fluid up	NONE	NONE	D D O O D O O O O
1015	and that was it	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1016	that was it probably	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1017	it was	NONE	NONE	O O
1018	i was so irritated	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1019	and that 's happened to me more than once or twice just just about every time i 've went in somewhere	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O
1020	so what 's the solution to that i guess find a reputable service	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1021	and and you can hardly find one	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O
1022	the guy that 's doing most of my my car now goes to my church	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O
1023	and that 's the only reason i go to him because i know him	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1024	and i know he will tell me the truth	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
1025	because he does n't even charge me for for doing it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O D O O O
1026	so he 's not going to take me	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1027	i just pay for the parts	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1028	and he does it so	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1029	that 's wonderful	NONE	NONE	O O O
1030	you 're lucky	NONE	NONE	O O O
1031	i am	NONE	NONE	O O
1032	so i do n't know	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1033	i do n't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car they 're usually the worst one of all	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1034	we took our honda to the honda dealership	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1035	and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1036	and so idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1037	we they told us we just had to have one	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O
1038	and we bought one	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1039	we did n't no more need no new engine	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
1040	give me break	NONE	NONE	O O O
1041	so it was it was not good	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O
1042	do you know anyone that is is in a nursing home or has ever been in one	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O
1043	but i my grandparents were looking into it before	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O
1044	so i know what they 've said	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1045	i 'm trying to think	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1046	my wife 's grandmother had alzheimer 's	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1047	and they were going to put her into a a nursing home	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D O O O
1048	and they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O
1049	and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a a a a nuisance or worse than a nuisance	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D O O O O O O O
1050	she sort of went bananas	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1051	they thought it was too much of a bother	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
1052	and they could n't could n't deal with her	NONE	NONE	O O D D O O O O O
1053	so i guess you need to know whether it 's a a no deposit no return kind of thing whether	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O
1054	if they 're equipped too to handle the kind of patients you 're going to have put in there too	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1055	because i know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
1056	they wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1057	but they wanted to be independent as well have their own room	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
1058	my grandmother actually was in a a nursing home that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D O O O O
1059	there was a retirement hotel and then a	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1060	there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1061	so for the first few years she had her own apartment and made her own meals sometimes but could could also go and eat someplace else	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O
1062	and then as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to provide full-time care	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1063	and she did n't have to do anything anymore	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
1064	but my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1065	and that 's	NONE	NONE	O O O
1066	i do n't know whether that 's because they sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the the reason is	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O
1067	but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only six months or something	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1068	a lot of it 's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1069	they need health care	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1070	so they 're already ill before they go	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1071	that 's probably a large factor	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1072	if if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1073	then you only go there as a last resort	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
1074	or people send you there as a last resort	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
1075	that 's what my grandparents	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1076	it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1077	so that was their thinking	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1078	somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1079	and also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make so they would n't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1080	i guess that 's a problem too for people wait lists and all	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1081	i guess	NONE	NONE	O O
1082	you ca n't always get in when you want too	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
1083	and of course you ca n't just sit around and wait	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
1084	when you need it you need it i guess	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
1085	and the money is also another issue how you 're going to pay for it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1086	at that stage of life you only have so much money left	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
1087	and i guess it 's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1088	it is kind of fair	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1089	but it 's also not fair because they have their own children to raise	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1090	so it 's another problem	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1091	and you probably if it were you you probably would n't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1092	so it it 's just so complicated anymore i think	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O
1093	people outlive their savings	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1094	and with medicine being the way it is you 're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1095	and they 're not necessarily enjoying life anymore	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1096	maybe that 's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it 's not worth continuing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1097	it 's just a shame that 's the way it has to be	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1098	i think the retirement home idea 's a nice idea to go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1099	and cause if your spouse died all alone it 'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you to have friends	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1100	i 've known quite a few people that have gone to retirement communities	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1101	i do n't know if they have them back there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
1102	but here in california and in	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1103	i 've had three boys through i some child care each one of them	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1104	and now they 're in school	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1105	so it 's all over	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1106	but i guess i would say it 's not easy to find what most parents would want	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1107	i can profit by this because i 'm due with my first in about three months	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1108	is that right	NONE	NONE	O O O
1109	i guess the only rule i can think of is that i like to look for places with uh good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1110	if they 're associated with a college or a university they 're usually a pretty good bet	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1111	i think it 's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1112	you 'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1113	i guess not	NONE	NONE	O O O
1114	i suppose you 're absolutely right there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1115	for profit places i would really look at them awfully carefully	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
1116	but when i was when my kids were young i was teaching at a university	NONE	NONE	O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O
1117	and the child care center associated with our university was quite good	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
1118	so i felt confident that they 'd do right	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
1119	are n't do n't they kind of use them for everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs for their for their pet theories or some such thing	NONE	NONE	D D O O D D D D D D O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O
1120	you mean learning type actual experiments they would have to get your permission	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O

1250	trial by jury is good	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1251	but a lot of time a lot of cases is circumstantial evidence that that convicts a person which i do n't think is all the time good because sometimes it 's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent prove a person guilty if you do n't really know or you do n't really have an eyewitness	NONE	NONE	O D D D D O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

1255	i think so	NONE	NONE	O O O
1256	i i attended a trial in germany when i was a student	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O

1259	they 're experts in the law	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O

1269	what what i worry about is cases where it 's the government against the individual	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1270	that 's where you really need a jury of peers because anytime the government is the government against the individual you need you need the protection of ordinary citizens	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O
1271	that 's true	NONE	NONE	O O O
1272	i think that 's really the only thing i guess where i would like to see the system change is there ought to be a a i guess i do n't think that juries need to decide sentencing all the time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1273	i think maybe a judge is a better judge of that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
1274	sometimes the sentencing is still is not fair	NONE	NONE	O O O D D O O O

1277	in a case like that most of the time its	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
1278	i do n't know	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1279	maybe i 'm too too conservative when it comes to that	NONE	NONE	O O O D O O O O O O O
1280	the sentencing is really light compared to what i think they should be in a lot of cases	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1281	if you drag twelve people into a courtroom i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone 's guilty or innocent	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1282	that 's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1283	but people who do n't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see i think that is maybe a little bit naive	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1284	in texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1285	it 's kind of a hanging jury atmosphere	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1286	but in a lot of places i think people bend over the other way	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1287	but i guess i guess i like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he 's goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1288	some some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O
1289	i kind of like that system	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1290	that 's that 's not a bad system	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O
1291	but i i do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O
1292	but the thing is too maybe they need more of a i do n't more of a expert types to to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and call them in	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D D D O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1293	and lawyers blow sand in their eyes	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1294	i would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1295	insurance cases and things like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1296	and there would be more honest settlements instead of this tugging of people 's heart strings and making them cry and feel like they 're doing somebody good by giving them or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

1564	in high school i went to every football game	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
1565	and i twirled	NONE	NONE	O O O

1567	i still do n't know that much about football obviously	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
1568	but i still had a good time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1569	the question was talking about the juries	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1570	and one of the things i thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having that especially for repeat offenders that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O
1571	maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1572	so that a judge i would be the most appropriate person to to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1573	i i kind of agree with that because i think in some cases the jury may not even have the information about other crimes the person has committed	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1574	i i think that in some cases that 's considered to prejudice the current case	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1575	so a judge you right should have the whole dossier of the criminal there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1576	and if they 're judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate sentencing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1577	i agree with you	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1578	one thing i heard was this where they have instead of going to the regular court they have a a mock court	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O D O O O
1579	it 's supposed to be all legal and everything	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
1580	you go	NONE	NONE	O O
1581	and you present your case	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1582	the other side presents their case	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1583	and you 're done with it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1584	it 's almost like the night court we see on t v	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
1585	and but it 's not that we have such	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O
1586	it did n't backlog or all of the the cases that are all ready pending	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O D O O O O O O O
1587	so i	NONE	NONE	O O
1588	that was one thing i thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1589	in other words not not	NONE	NONE	O O O D O
1590	there would be some types of crimes for which you 're not guaranteed a jury trial	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1591	i i i do n't	NONE	NONE	D D O O O
1592	there 's a point on which we do n't agree	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
1593	i would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a anytime a one of the parties wants one	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O D O O O O O O
1594	and i usually it is the defendant i that wants to have the jury hear the case	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1595	so i 'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we take that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1596	that would require a change in the bill of rights i believe	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
1597	and so	NONE	NONE	O O
1598	and and i was n't i did n't mean that	NONE	NONE	D O D D D O O O O O
1599	i i did n't mean that	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O
1600	because if i was did n't have that right not to have a jury that	NONE	NONE	O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O
1601	i would feel you right that my civil rights had been violated	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
1602	but i meant for some when both parties agreed that we 're going to have a judge here	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1603	we 're not going to have a jury	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1604	let 's get it over with	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1605	sort of like car accidents	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1606	i think that 's all ready possible	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1607	i think that you can waive the right to a jury trial	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
1608	so i agree that that should be encouraged	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1609	people should know that that 's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1610	but i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to to clients unless they feel they can tweak a jury into giving a different sentence or possibly if it 's a civil case giving higher awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the the award	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O
1611	giving a different sentence	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1612	the take	NONE	NONE	O O
1613	and i suspect it in cases like	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1614	i guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1615	is that right	NONE	NONE	O O O
1616	i i we 're at liberty to to talk and and meander as long as it 's all on the same theme	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O D O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O
1617	in the case of civil things i maybe the the use of the jury is very often to the lawyer 's advantage	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1618	and i think that may be where jury use is overdone	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
1619	there are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1620	but the lawyers are really	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1621	it 's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1622	so i was wondering too if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in in a criminal cases	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O
1623	i 'm not so sure i 'm in favor of that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
1624	but i am in favor of it for criminal cases	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
1625	so there 's a difference of my view there for those two	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
1626	you can tell i have n't been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O

2236	and then we did n't have prohibition	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O

2248	they they support drug habits with with with things like burglary or or prostitution or stuff like that	NONE	NONE	D O O O O D D O O O O D O O O O O O
2249	it goes back to that again if you look at prohibition because it 's illegal it costs more	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2250	if it was legal	NONE	NONE	O O O O

2255	i i must admit that the production costs of of these drugs are are zippo compared to the street market costs and and the costs to society	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O D O O O D O O O O O O O O D O O O O O
2256	that 's why there 's people dealing it because there 's money in it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2257	there 's ridiculous amounts of money	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O

2277	everybody ought to do their own share i do n't have any love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they 're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2278	i guess it 's an easy one for me	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2279	i think that 's there 's something seriously wrong	NONE	NONE	O O D D O O O O O
2280	what is it that you are particularly upset about	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2281	i guess i think they 've lost their compass	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O
2282	and i 'm not sure they know exactly what public education supposed to be for anymore	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2283	but i voted with my feet	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2284	and my kids go to parochial school	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
2285	what do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they would n't get in a the public school system	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O
2286	one hundred percent of the customers care	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
2287	that 's one thing	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2288	everybody cares about the education the kids are getting	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2289	and they take an active relatively active part	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O
2290	which if you 're sending two thousand dollars that way every year you watch what goes on and you pay attention and participate	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2291	and and you can influence the way things are	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O
2292	so you 're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of real estate or other taxes	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

2294	the immediacy just is n't there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O

2296	and actually i do n't think this i think this is a cultural problem	NONE	NONE	O O D D D D D O O O O O O O
2297	the problem with public education is really really a problem with the culture	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O O O O O
2298	and i guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like california for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2299	and you ca n't get a tax levy passed	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2300	people are reluctant to pass school tax levies even when the money is needed or would be well spent because it 's they do n't have kids in the schools	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O
2301	i think that 's a a loss of civic virtue and a loss of the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it was n't our kids	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2302	i think that 's that 's the principal problem is that people no longer see it as as their problem	NONE	NONE	O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O
2303	and there 's an immediate problem	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2304	it troubles me too that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2305	and by definition for some of us at least the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in the at the local level or bigger votes at the national level	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O
2306	it means that you 've got to be informed	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2307	and you 've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2308	i i believe that the original idea of public education in the united states which i guess was controversial at the time of the constitution it barely made it	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2309	i think it was added afterwards	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2310	i think the real the principal was education for civic participation	NONE	NONE	O O D D O O O O O O O
2311	the idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2312	and you could n't pull the wool over their eyes	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
2313	it has taken on a more profound and you 'd we 'd notice it economic thrust	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2314	that 's exactly what i was going to say	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2315	now there seem to be really three reasons for education	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
2316	one is education for civic duty	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2317	one is education for economic reasons	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2318	and one is education for civilization	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2319	and i think that one	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2320	i 'm glad that you added that one	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
2321	i think that one 's significant	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2322	that 's what i used to think education was all about when i was a college professor	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2323	and then i quit and got disabused of that notion	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
2324	but the the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is an economic enterprise to train people for jobs	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2325	and i 'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2326	and i 'm really sad to say this	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
2327	i never thought i would have	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2328	but i really think that the educational establishment has become part of the problem	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2329	and that 's why i i 'm sort of reluctantly in favor of these choice programs	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2330	i i agree with everything that you 've said so far	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O
2331	and the only that i 'd want to add is that i 'm a little more in contact i with public school teachers than perhaps you are except as a parent of your child	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2332	and the sense that i get from public school teachers that i know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2333	and they are the three things that you mentioned	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2334	but they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2335	that 's what	NONE	NONE	O O O

2393	that they say it it all it takes is about five ten minutes a day	NONE	NONE	D O O D D O O O O O O O O O O

2406	but it never worked that way	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2407	so they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2408	and we could bring up and we could bring up stuff too	NONE	NONE	D D D D D O O O O O O O

2423	you do n't think of it that way do you	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
2424	but that that was always good quality time for us	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O

2426	i like that idea	NONE	NONE	O O O O

2555	although i have a	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2556	i i kind of wonder if some if it were possible to market some form of space technology to to make it equitable it might severely help the economy in the in the respect that there 's endless amounts of research to be done endless amounts of resources and and whatnot	NONE	NONE	D O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O
2557	it would be great if we could find some way to to use that to boost the economy	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O
2558	i 've always felt that one of the long-term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have some sort of solar power satellites up	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2559	because that 's a in singularly renewable resource that does n't do it that does n't require any particularly nasty environment impact	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O D D D D D O O O O O O O O O

2561	it 's just a matter of how big you build it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
2562	and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that i think we should be doing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2563	so the side effects of doing that which i think would be good very very good for for everyone in the long run is is it some of the other things i 'd like to see happen would happen also	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O D O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2564	so i 'm	NONE	NONE	O O O
2565	it seems like there 's	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2566	so you 're talking about positive side effects then	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2567	i understand	NONE	NONE	O O
2568	that makes a lot of sense	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2569	the only problem is of course that that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2570	and they want to do the research	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
2571	and they 're all	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2572	the only commitments that they 're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like the trip to mars which is would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O
2573	but the same money could probably be far better spent on lunar bases and solar power satellite research and so forth	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2574	it it would it would be being done for the glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of instead of for	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O
2575	we should eventually send someone people to mars but not just because it 's glitzy to do so	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2576	we should do it because for for the return we get for it	NONE	NONE	O O O O D D O O O O O O O
2577	and unfortunately that 's not what i thinks happened	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2578	least not	NONE	NONE	O O
2579	i i would settle for the for the glitz if the side effects were useful like the	NONE	NONE	D O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O
2580	the downside of that is you after you do one of those people say we did it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O
2581	now let 's now we 're done	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O

2692	if you if they make you an offer then they 'll test you right before you start	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2693	and i guess the only drawback i can see to to drug testing is in in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O D O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2694	and that that definitely happens	NONE	NONE	O D O O O
2695	those the drug tests they 're accurate	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O
2696	but there 's always that margin of error	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
2697	and that 's that 's something to be aware of	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O
2698	another thing is a lot of times they are n't that accurate	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
2699	they are n't that sensitive	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2700	if you 're on a prescription drug of some kind what are they going to do about that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2701	i was on a couple of different prescription drugs when i was tested for honeywell	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2702	and i know they did n't catch that or else they would have said something	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2703	i 'm sure they screen for just a particular few types	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
2704	although the literature they give with you says we do this	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
2705	and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2706	i do n't know	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2707	what what program are you in over at carnegie mellon	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O
2708	electrical engineering	NONE	NONE	O O
2709	i 'm a graduate student at u c f in florida university of central florida	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2710	and this is actually a an internship up here	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2711	but they even for interns they they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing	NONE	NONE	O D O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O
2712	they test you before they before you start or before you even interview	NONE	NONE	O O O D D O O O O O O O O
2713	they essentially	NONE	NONE	O O
2714	i sure do n't	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2715	they essentially they essentially made me the offer and then and then did the drug testing thing after that	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O
2716	so it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O
2717	and and then they essentially give you the offer	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O
2718	and then at that point they 'll they 'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2719	so there 's some noise on this end	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
2720	i 'm actually in a mall calling	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
2721	you probably wondered	NONE	NONE	O O O

2724	that 's a good question	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2725	i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave if you fail i they give you one more chance	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2726	they probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2727	but once again those things are not that accurate	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2728	so there 's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
2729	are you working right now anywhere	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2730	i 'm just about to finish my master 's in may and just interviewing with companies right now	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

2736	and we both had to go through drug testing at the same time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2737	so one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2738	did do they test you at right now at work too	NONE	NONE	D O O O O D O O O O O
2739	that 's one thing they do n't do is is drug testing while you 're on the job	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O
2740	i think i think the unwritten rule is expect it	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O O

3016	here 's something that has been kind of concerning me lately	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
3017	my fiance received a bill from a a lord and taylor company	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O O O O
3018	they 're a they 're a department store	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O
3019	she received a bill from them that she had visited some	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
3020	and and i think it was there in florida	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O
3021	maybe it was in miami	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3022	that she had visited a store there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
3023	and they had this bill that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3024	and the date that that she supposedly made this purchase she was in denver with me for thanksgiving	NONE	NONE	O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3025	and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3026	and and i 've i 've heard recently that that this is a common occurrence where people are using	NONE	NONE	D O D D O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O
3027	they use joe blow 's social security number and can potentially ruin someone 's credit	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3028	if you know a person 's social security number and their mailing address and their mother 's maiden name you can basically become that person	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3029	if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3030	and since it was n't shipped to her address she could prove that it was n't her	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3031	if it was some coming into the store and stuff then she would whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of document	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O
3032	the signature	NONE	NONE	O O
3033	they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3034	and if they ca n't provide a signature they 'll have to eat the charge	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3035	but if the has their social her social security number i 'd be real concerned that they that she 's not blacklist on is it it 's telecredit or something	NONE	NONE	O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3036	because she wo n't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3037	she probably wo n't be able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3038	we got it cleared up eventually	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3039	what happened	NONE	NONE	O O
3040	i 'm of the age that could have gone although i did n't	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3041	and i looking back on it i tend to think it was pretty mostly a mistake	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O
3042	on the other hand the more i learn about the history the more i see it was incremental decisions any one of which was sort of understandable at the time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3043	and but on the whole i think it probably was the wrong thing to do	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3044	how about you	NONE	NONE	O O O
3045	i 'm i i was just in high school i when it when it ended	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O D D O O O
3046	ended up being	NONE	NONE	O O O
3047	i was in the last last lottery	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O
3048	and i was glad it was over by then	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
3049	i 've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3050	just because we did n't really do anything when we went over it seems like	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3051	those people that i know	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3052	i work with several that were over there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
3053	and for some of them it was just kind of i do n't not so much a holiday	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3054	i guess that 's how they tend to talk about it but that they just kind of lived out in the woods	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3055	and ever now and then they 'd go and shoot their rifles	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3056	and then they 'd come back	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3057	but that they were n't really allowed to do anything	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
3058	to me it seems like we only went halfway if even halfway	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3059	it 's funny	NONE	NONE	O O O
3060	tonight i was helping my kid with an essay on stalin	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
3061	and i was thinking in the course of talking to him about it how in world war two the personalties of stalin hitler and churchill more or less defined the war	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3062	and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was it was almost a personal struggle among these three i guess you 'd have to call them great men in some sense	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3063	they 're certainly all leaders	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3064	and and with their nations pretty pretty solidly behind each one of them	NONE	NONE	D O O O O D O O O O O O O
3065	and i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the early decisions of the vietnam war that the people saw the cold war as you had to draw a line and and defend it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O
3066	otherwise there 'd be they 'd get you someplace else	NONE	NONE	O D D D O O O O O O
3067	looking back it seems like that was only partly true that there might have been a better place to draw the line	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3068	i guess you can i guess you can say that a a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight brought the cold war to an end	NONE	NONE	D D D D O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3069	but i do n't think you can just fight anywhere just just in order to call the bully out and beat him	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O
3070	and i have a feeling that that 's part of what was involved in the vietnamese war	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3071	they felt like this was a place where we could draw a line beat them and they would n't come forward	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3072	and we were wrong	NONE	NONE	O O O O
3073	but i	NONE	NONE	O O
3074	the like i said the more i hear about it the more i can see each decision that was made as being understandable	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3075	but the accumulative effect was to really get into a a hopeless situation where	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O D O O O O
3076	and as you say going halfway was probably worse than committing committing to a completely and winning it whatever that would mean	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O
3077	i i i think we did i think we did learn some lessons that we were n't we were n't prepared for	NONE	NONE	D D D D D D O O O O O O O O D D D O O O O O
3078	i guess the best word would be the atrocities of war	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
3079	the other wars seemed like a valiant war they seemed like a valiant thing	NONE	NONE	O O O D D D D D O O O O O O
3080	you knew you knew who was good	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O
3081	you knew who was bad	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3082	and it was a it was a traditional the traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you you know whichever way it is	NONE	NONE	O D D D O O O D D O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O
3083	you 're not	NONE	NONE	O O O
3084	but in in the vietnam war it seems like it was	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O
3085	a a the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who 's good and who 's bad	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3086	and and the	NONE	NONE	D O O
3087	it 's ambivalent	NONE	NONE	O O O
3088	even it seems like even the people	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
3089	had the south vietnamese the north vietnamese and of course the laotians	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3090	and the cambodians were n't even supposed to be involved	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
3091	what what about the domestic effects	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O
3092	i was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it possible and even popular to criticize the government	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3093	and they	NONE	NONE	O O
3094	that pendulum started to swing maybe even too far to the point where supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the vietnam war on	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3095	and that tradition is still	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3096	it 's dying now	NONE	NONE	O O O O
3097	but it 's still alive as opposed to	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
3098	this desert storm stuff may have killed it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
3099	but i think that was one of the biggest that the the domestic unrest	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D O O O
3100	generally i get most of my news in the weekly magazines like time newsweek and and u s news and world report with with occasional smatterings of of the wall street journal and of course the local paper	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O D O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O
3101	but my my only complaint is i really do n't enough time to to look at the articles every day and and go through a paper exhaust the details	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O
3102	so that 's why i concentrate on weekly magazines	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
3103	do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you 'd like	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3104	i i i i do n't think i have the time to really become a student in every article	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3105	and and so i i i like the weekly magazines because it gives me the high points of what 's going on	NONE	NONE	D O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3106	but many times the the local the local news kind of suffers	NONE	NONE	O O O D D D O O O O O O
3107	but here i am cheek by jowl with our nation 's capital	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3108	that 's right	NONE	NONE	O O O
3109	you 're very close actually	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3110	it 's almost a bedroom community for the capital	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
3111	when when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway i 'm saying to myself guys i 'm inside the beltway	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3112	but it turns out that that that the c n n is i is great and for for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events	NONE	NONE	O O O O D D O O O O O D O O O O D O O O O O O O O
3113	but generally they 're they 're they 're more sound bitish kind of thing	NONE	NONE	O O D D D D O O O O O O O O
3114	and and i do n't really i do n't really feel as though i 've a gotten sufficient dose of news that way	NONE	NONE	D O D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3115	a lot of my information comes from several sources	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
3116	probably pretty high up on the list is national public radio which i like	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

3186	i did n't send them back	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3187	i just put them away	NONE	NONE	O O O O O

3216	i do almost all my purchasing on credit cards	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O

3246	when we went want to go out to eat we go out to eat	NONE	NONE	O O D O O O O O O O O O O O

3253	but but but when	NONE	NONE	D D O O
3254	i really am am concerned about is that so many of these child care places are are coming under investigation for for child molestation	NONE	NONE	O O D O O D D O O O O O O O O D O O O O D O O O
3255	and i and i and i 'm saying to myself you dump your your your little turnip off to this child care place	NONE	NONE	D D D D O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O
3256	and they do n't pay very much	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O

3258	and that 's a terrible kind of thing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
3259	and i do n't think my children have ever been subject to that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3260	but my wife did n't work	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3261	and so we really did n't have that much exposure to it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3262	i am a working mother	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3263	i have three children	NONE	NONE	O O O O

3268	and my kids i are very very secure well raised children	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D O O O O O
3269	my comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3270	so i i i	NONE	NONE	O D D O
3271	it is a problem	NONE	NONE	O O O O
3272	and but as you pointed out i i think the real problem is the low pay child facilities	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O
3273	and that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3274	when our children were very young we had a pay a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O

3281	we were paying at one point about about a close about five hundred dollars a week for two children	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D D D O O O O O O O O O O

3448	i i 'm employed by a company that does do random drug testing	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O

3453	my employer does not do that although i had an ex-employer that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3454	the previous job i used to have they	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
3455	after i a few years after i had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3456	i i do n't know	NONE	NONE	D O O O O
3457	my feeling is that certain jobs that when there 's immediate threat to life and limb if should somebody be under the influence of drugs i i 'd be willing to support that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O
3458	for example train engineers	NONE	NONE	O O O O
3459	because it there was an incident several years ago where an amtrak engineer	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O
3460	he crashed and killed some people because he was smoking some marijuana	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3461	and i guess air traffic controllers i would n't want them to be on drugs and airplane pilots	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3462	but where it 's not necessary in that regard where it 's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property i i 'd i would seriously question it	NONE	NONE	O D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D O O O O O
3463	it that 's that 's mine	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O

3465	i i go back	NONE	NONE	D O O O
3466	it to me no matter how much the our company claims it 's not a constitutional issue that because this is between a company and an employee it is not it is not a government	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D O O O O O
3467	it 's not	NONE	NONE	O O O
3468	the constitution does n't apply	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3469	but i it it seems to me that it still should	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O O
3470	i i our company 's doing it because they 're a government contractor	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O O O O O
3471	and so it 's it 's required for certain some form some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts	NONE	NONE	O O D D D D D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O
3472	and i 'd i 'd	NONE	NONE	O D D O O
3473	so it 's the government that 's mandating it to a certain extent	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3474	and our company has taken that and gone all the way	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
3475	first off we do n't we do n't have enough courage to pick out the people that that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage because that would offend them if they if they were n't	NONE	NONE	O O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O
3476	so we 'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

3480	it 's random in the sense that you do n't know when	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3481	it is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3482	and i i sit at a terminal and and write software all day	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O D O O O O O
3483	it it certainly has no life threatening capabilities in in my job	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O D O O O

3485	i i agree that there are there are jobs that are definitely life threatening	NONE	NONE	D O O O D D O O O O O O O O

3487	i agree	NONE	NONE	O O
3488	it 's there 's also the issue of	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O
3489	out here i remember hearing a year or so ago that a lot of	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3490	there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3491	or i should n't say high	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3492	i mean several percent	NONE	NONE	O O O O
3493	i that that i that i will give credit to to our our company for in that that i think there 's there 's a couple of levels of tests in terms of of of drugs	NONE	NONE	D D D D O O O O O D O D O O O O D O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O D D O O
3494	and essentially the first thing is is on the order of paper in the urine and or some	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O D O O
3495	it 's not quite that simple	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3496	but it 's fairly simple	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3497	kind of a coarse kind of test	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
3498	coarse kind of test	NONE	NONE	O O O O
3499	and then there 's a a much more refined test spectrography or whatever it 's called the chemotography to determine exactly what the what the things are	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O
3500	is that done	NONE	NONE	O O O
3501	now let me ask you this	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3502	at the time you hired on with this company was that prior to any	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3503	i i 've been with this company for for sixteen years now	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O D O O O O
3504	so that this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3505	and it and it and it has it has	NONE	NONE	D D D D O D D O O
3506	they did that three or four years before they did it with everybody	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3507	and i at that time i could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you do n't you do n't know	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D O O O O
3508	but on the other hand someone new coming in that knows they 're going to have a test	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

3513	about maybe close to a year ago now i i i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O
3514	so i guess that	NONE	NONE	O O O O
3515	the whole thing	NONE	NONE	O O O
3516	that that was fairly large undertaking	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O
3517	a a it 's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3518	did the framing and all	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3519	we did it all except for the sheetrocking	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
3520	that was the only thing we did n't putting the ceiling up and things like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3521	we do n't we we were n't sure how to do that	NONE	NONE	D D D D O O O O O O O O
3522	maybe you and i should get together because when i had my last big project i had the contractor do the framing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3523	and i did all the sheetrocking and the interior work	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O

3525	we did all put the roof up and did all the roofing and the put all the interior walls up	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O
3526	we just did n't do any of the sheetrock wall work	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O

3700	that 's interesting	NONE	NONE	O O O

3702	and he wanted another collection a year later	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O

3704	a year ago i did eleven calls	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
3705	i see	NONE	NONE	O O
3706	and so that 's that 's why that 's why i 'm religiously getting on the phone because i have a unique i have a unique situation here in that if i do n't participate	NONE	NONE	O O D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3707	and you say you have some strong feelings about the issue	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
3708	i do as far as as far as as far as immigration as a whole goes	NONE	NONE	O O D D D D D D O O O O O O O O
3709	i think that we simply must start accepting everybody in the world	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3710	there just is not going to be room for all of us	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3711	we do n't have jobs now	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3712	i i think i think when we come to a time of recession that it 's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3713	i hope you 're one of the employed right now	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O

3715	i was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
3716	and i applied for one set of jobs with a company here in dallas that they had two hundred openings	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3717	but they had two thousand applications	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3718	and i know that there are a lot of foreigners here doing my line of work	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3719	and of course i 'm not perfectly happy about not having a job	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3720	how do you feel	NONE	NONE	O O O O
3721	i 'm a little bit ambivalent	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3722	the problem with and i think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it in in terms of what really is driving it	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O
3723	they 're not willing to tell the truth the same way with issues of race and things like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3724	right now i believe there are two policies that that the government uses to modulate immigration three actually	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O
3725	one is at the high end	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3726	they always want to be able to do some brain draining	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
3727	they always like to be able to attract the einsteins or the professor chou	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3728	they 'd like to be able to get the top people in any field	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3729	and so they can almost always find room for someone like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3730	at the bottom end they are always willing to let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3731	those are two things that i think are going on although they i i do n't think the politicians would tell you that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O
3732	and i think you 're right in both cases	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
3733	and then the third thing is the political aspect of letting steam come out from under the lid in mexico	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3734	they can not close off the mexican border not because it 's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in mexico would be would spill over to this country	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O
3735	so they keep allowing the pressure cooker to let off steam	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
3736	and i think probably it 's pretty important right there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
3737	how do you feel about haitian immigration	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
3738	that 's one of the few things i i found myself in agreement with pat buchanan	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3739	i think they 're a very difficult group to integrate into society	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3740	they 're very difficult group to find jobs and and places for	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D O O O
3741	and so i do n't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem that in that they 're pretty miserable where they are	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O
3742	but i 'm not to sympathetic about letting large numbers of haitians in	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3743	actually actually i feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3744	and it would have nothing to do with political situations	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
3745	it would have to do with poverty	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
3746	but if you let them if you let them in a million at a time it would n't make that it would n't make that big a bulge in the population but politically and economically	NONE	NONE	O D D D D O O O O O O O O O O D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3747	have you been have you been to southern florida	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O

3752	it 's just as well	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3753	it 's hardly america anymore	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3754	on the other hand the ironic thing about this is that there 's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial american spirit than our first generation immigrant	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3755	so there 's there 's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3756	but there 's some differences in the immigrants that that we 're getting now	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D O O O O O
3757	i particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
3758	i think probably your a great deal of what you say is true about the legals	NONE	NONE	O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O

3768	but i gather you do not separate the bottles and cans	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O

3778	that is we also have blue bins	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
3779	we also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and landfill space is in deed the driving factor here	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3780	and in fact despite all of our open space out here landfill space is still very hard to come by	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
