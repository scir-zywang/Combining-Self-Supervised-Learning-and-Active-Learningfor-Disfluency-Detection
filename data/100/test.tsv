333	read my lips or whatever and then ten months later he said i i ca n't follow through on this	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

362	i think it was in the tax year of eighty-one	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
363	ronald reagan basically said i 'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and and created this this ludicrous budget that he knew that that that the congress would not in their right mind pass	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O D O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O
364	and congress realizing that they were going to lose a the democratic congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and created that that that created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit	NONE	NONE	O D D D D D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

374	for for the moment	NONE	NONE	D O O O

394	and they 've had some impact but not a tremendous amount	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O

396	i probably agree with that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
397	particularly in some of the housing projects that 's that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O

497	and they	NONE	NONE	O O
498	the dryer had to have a new heating element	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O

510	it 's frustrating	NONE	NONE	O O O
511	but i did n't have to worry about all that because they were n't under warranty	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
512	so it was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

530	we test everything after each assembly process	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
531	and so our testing is pretty thorough	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
532	do you do you test each individual one	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O
533	or do you just test	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
534	if you 've got ten you test one	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
535	and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
536	the tests that	NONE	NONE	O O O
537	we test every one electrically	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
538	we do n't	NONE	NONE	O O O
539	i think they test four or five a day actually exploding the air bags	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
540	and but we do test after during the assembly project product after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it 's there after we install it	NONE	NONE	D O O O O D O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
541	so each assembly process has an inspection right after it 's done	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
542	and then we do electrical tests on them during the process	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O

544	it 's never i 've never been involved in an automobile accident	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O

547	i 'm i 'm	NONE	NONE	D D O O
548	seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
549	but that	NONE	NONE	O O
550	they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government	NONE	NONE	O O D O O O O O O O O O O O
551	it 's incredible how much testing they have to do	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
552	i 'm sure they want to be thorough before they	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
553	but even	NONE	NONE	O O
554	i do n't mind spending the extra money on the car if even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
555	i 'm not a real big seat belt	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
556	i guess we 're going to talk describe job benefits	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O O
557	and so what do you think next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
558	i would say the medical group insurance area as far as covering medical costs for yourself or family members	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
559	does your company have good benefits in that in that regard	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D D O O O
560	i think	NONE	NONE	O O
561	i work for a public school system district	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O
562	and so it 's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
563	where the school district does the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of costs	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
564	but overall i 've been pleased with it over the years	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
565	i think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district has had to alter change companies	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O
566	or now we 're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
567	i see	NONE	NONE	O O
568	how about yourself	NONE	NONE	O O O
569	i 'm	NONE	NONE	O O
570	my medical coverage is with an h m o	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
571	so that 's in my opinion that 's that 's bordering on a health clinic	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O D D O O O O O O O
572	but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
573	our district did that for the ninety-one and the ninety school year or calendar years	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O
574	and i was in the h m o	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
575	and i was because my my same doctor agreed to be in it for	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O O O O O O O
576	they usually sign a contract or something	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
577	and i did have surgery last summer	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
578	and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
579	and i 've never seen another bill	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
580	so i i have to say it really works	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O
581	but again i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
582	if you 've been going to a doctor for ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for those people	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
583	that 's right	NONE	NONE	O O O
584	i 'm i 'm fairly young myself	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O
585	i 've only been	NONE	NONE	O O O O
586	when i first started working which	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O

588	and at that time i immediately joined the h m o	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
589	and i never really	NONE	NONE	O O O O
590	so the only doctor i i 've kind of consistently had has been through the h m o	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
591	and for me it 's worked out real good	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
592	but if you have a family and and everybody 's gone to different doctors it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your just has all the medical history	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O
593	and you feel comfortable with it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
594	i i 'm sure it would be very stressful	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O
595	and my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
596	you can continue to go to your own doctor	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O

599	i work for georgia tech in the research branch	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O

740	i do n't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
741	i think you get a very lopsided picture of what 's going on	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
742	because they can they can only report on	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O

789	i think that one advantage of having the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you do n't convict someone who really should n't be convicted	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
790	and i think that a unanimous verdict helps to ensure that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
791	i guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that you would have a problem that you would n't convict someone who maybe should be convicted	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

803	so it was	NONE	NONE	O O O
804	and the one changed his vote at the end	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
805	so did it become	NONE	NONE	O O O O
806	so it became unanimous after they turned it in	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O

823	but i i have n't	NONE	NONE	O D O O O
824	one one thing that i i think is maybe is a problem is i i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now	NONE	NONE	D O O O D O O D O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O
825	but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it does n't work as well	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
826	especially sort of	NONE	NONE	O O O
827	i would n't think that it does from from my from what i experienced in them	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O D D D O O O O O O
828	it did n't it did n't turn out the way i planned it the way that i would think that it would go	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
829	you thought it turned out pretty well	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
830	but it was it was	NONE	NONE	O D D O O
831	jury was unorganized	NONE	NONE	O O O
832	and it was it was just was n't organized enough for me	NONE	NONE	O D D O D O O O O O O O
833	i 'm not used to it not being organized	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
834	and i just assumed that it would have been	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
835	so it was just kind of a zoo	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
836	and the jurors just sort of	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
837	someone had to figure out what was going on	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
838	that 's about what it was	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
839	that 's interesting	NONE	NONE	O O O
840	did it did it work out pretty well in the end	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O O O
841	did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume sort of a moderator role in the trial	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
842	they they picked one person	NONE	NONE	D O O O O
843	and then he finally moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
844	so it it did end up working out pretty well	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O
845	it ended up working all right	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
846	the one thing i sometimes wonder about in civil cases is whether especially sort of in maybe product liability or medical malpractice where there 's sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
847	it 's not just a matter of of did this guy rip off this guy	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O
848	and it 's just a matter of interpreting a contract	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
849	it 's sort of a matter of sometimes getting into very technical issues	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
850	and i wonder if if there 's really if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about whatever issue is under discussion	NONE	NONE	O O O D D D D D O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O
851	i i do n't think that they they they educate them enough to to really know what 's going on	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O D D O O O O D O O O O O O O
852	in in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
853	the the bank was suing them for because they went to get the the trailer that which was seemingly their property	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O D O O O O O D O O D O O O O O

856	and he had n't made the payments	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
857	so they came to get it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O

859	and he would n't let them take it off	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
860	so they were suing to get it back	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
861	so and they are it was a double wide	NONE	NONE	D O D D O O O O O
862	so they 'd already taken it apart	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
863	so they left it there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O

881	it was it was 's see it was municipal court	NONE	NONE	D D D D O O O O O O

916	so they appointed me jury jury foreman	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O
917	and i did n't think that going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
918	so i told the judge that we were n't were unable to reach a verdict because we could n't get one member of the jury to deliberate	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

927	cost him a lot of money	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
928	i 'm sure	NONE	NONE	O O O

1193	one of the things i 'm very concerned about the air pollution is the this this the ozone layer issue	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D O O O O
1194	i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of different types of freons	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1195	and that rather bothers me that i was in in effect contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O D O O O O O
1196	that 's stuff we never even thought about three years ago	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
1197	and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O
1198	they could be made inexpensive and lots of it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O

1307	i can begin this	NONE	NONE	O O O O

1312	you name it	NONE	NONE	O O O
1313	and for me this is the first job i 've had where they 've covered that much	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1314	so i 'm pretty satisfied myself	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1315	what 's your situation	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1316	i work for the university of new hampshire	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1317	and our benefits package is n't is n't quite as good in some ways	NONE	NONE	O O O O D D O O O O O O O O
1318	overall i 'm satisfied with it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1319	we do n't have the vision care	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1320	we do have the health care and the and the or the dental	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D D O O O O O

1324	i see	NONE	NONE	O O
1325	so the the benefits probably the main thing i like about the benefits is the the very generous vacation time and sick time	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O
1326	no doubt	NONE	NONE	O O
1327	we get fifteen days a year sick time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O

1334	you maybe get two or three a year	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1335	so it 's really	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1336	unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1337	so that 's that 's kind of a drawback i think	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O O
1338	but i do n't know	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1339	what do you consider most important you in terms of of the different benefits	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O D O O O O

1341	and the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
1342	i 'm i 'm a little disturbed about that	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O
1343	but i think that 's a national trend	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1344	and i do n't know that i do n't know what the solution is to it	NONE	NONE	O D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O
1345	it 's bigger than just the benefits part	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1346	i do n't know if you saw on twenty twenty the other night they they basically reviewed oregon 's plan or the oregon plan toward nationalizing health care and that kind of thing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1347	it 's kind of an interesting plan	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1348	it 's kind of cold though	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1349	they 've essentially made up a list of all the different medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

1354	if you do n't you 're kind of out of luck	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O

1377	for the operating staff it 's on a seniority it 's based on how long they 've worked there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D D D O O O O O O O O O O

1390	i guess one of the differences i see is working for a university there is room for advancement but not so much so our in quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1391	so there is a progressive path	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1392	but not being in the the commercial sector the motivation is n't there for a lot of people really	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1393	are they pretty much train for a specific job	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
1394	and that what i hired for and then i just very little variation from that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O
1395	somewhat that	NONE	NONE	O O
1396	but then also there just is n't the ability to in one sense have a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1397	so that 's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1398	it 's a little more difficult to recognize an individual 's performance	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
1399	and i suppose that 's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution perhaps somewhat even with the business	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1400	but i agree the medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the security aspect for long term employment	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1401	that 's interesting though	NONE	NONE	O O O O

1403	i use to think that after you work	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O

1406	that use to be i a couple of years ago	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O

1410	some people had been there a long time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O

1412	in some of the large oil companies there has been massive lay offs	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1413	i i think there it 's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses we need to cut back that 's what we do	NONE	NONE	D O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1414	no doubt	NONE	NONE	O O
1415	and institutionally like here at the university if there is a cut back it 's not where it necessarily where it 's needed	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D O O O O
1416	it 's where it 's most expedient which in one sense for us it 's where it makes the least noise which means it 's often the lowest support type roles	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1417	that 's exactly it	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1418	where the most dollar where where it cuts back the most	NONE	NONE	D D D D D O O O O O O
1419	i think that 's one of the things too	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
1420	you get too many management people	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1421	it 's very easy	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1422	and it 's very easy for them to say this is the best way when they really are n't aware of what all it took to get the work done	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1423	and then they wonder why it does n't get done in the same amount of time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1424	those people are n't there anymore	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1425	because it 's support people that are providing the speed for it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
1426	what else do you think is important	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1427	that 's maybe the majority of the importance i guess	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
1428	because my perspective is from an institution	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1429	the there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1430	but if you 're in the corporate world i there is considerable motivation for i innovation	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1431	although he the more complex your structure the less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1432	but i think there is it 's a long term type of process where in a small organization it 's things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of the efforts	NONE	NONE	O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1433	i think probably in a small	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1434	i was going to say more it 's more personal for one thing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D O O O O O O O
1435	you probably have a better team cooperation or team playing atmosphere	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
1436	probably where as in a bigger corporation i think you 're just a number	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1437	you end up being your own person	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1438	and if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up then that 's their problem	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1439	and you really	NONE	NONE	O O O
1440	whereas in a smaller	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1441	i think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1442	it becomes the organization instead of person being a part of the individual themselves	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1443	how do you feel about trial by jury	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1444	i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
1445	in what way	NONE	NONE	O O O
1446	in that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than by evidence that 's presented	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1447	i have very little regard for the law presently practiced	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
1448	do do you feel they are swayed more toward are you talking about with criminal or civil suits	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1449	i was thinking primarily criminal cases	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1450	do you think that the the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O O O O O O O
1451	that 's a concern of mine	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1452	i would feel more comfortable in many cases i with judges doing the sentencing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1453	the other thing the only thing that really bothers me about that is i think that a judge can be	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1454	i i like the idea of juries of your peers in that you you you get more personally more than one person making the making a decision	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O D O O O O O D D O O O
1455	and second of all you get a wide variety of background so that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1456	my question i are they really your peers	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1457	i 'd agree with that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1458	too often i think they are not	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1459	that 's definitely a problem	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
1460	and when you when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have that is a matter of concern to me too	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1461	i think that in such cases they are not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1462	now i happen to know several judges	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
1463	and there is one that i would feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury i would feel a little bit uneasy about	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1464	but the other two i would give either the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1465	and i guess that 's what i am concerned with	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
1466	i guess i i definitely agree with you	NONE	NONE	O O D O O O O O
1467	but the	NONE	NONE	O O
1468	what i do n't like about sentence the jury doing the sentencing in that i think it becomes a lot less	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1469	the the same crime gets unequal sentences	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O
1470	this is very true	NONE	NONE	O O O O
1471	i i think there is more of an ability of for selecting a jury two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea the same idea versus whether he is guilty or innocent	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O D O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D O O O O O O O O O O
1472	but i think i think there would be a large variation in in trying to gage the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that that measure stick across the board	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O O D O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O
1473	and you do see such uneven sentencing evidence of it in the newspapers and such where it would appear the crimes were very similar	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1474	but one individual got twenty-five years	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1475	and the other one was sentenced to life	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
1476	of course a lot of that 's also the ability of of the defendant to get a good lawyer	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O
1477	is n't that the truth	NONE	NONE	O O O O O

1480	every now and then one is tempted to see what what	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O D O
1481	i agree	NONE	NONE	O O
1482	but i it 's taken me a long time to understand that lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of as as novices tend to think that attorneys care about justice	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O
1483	i i agree with it	NONE	NONE	D O O O O
1484	they will admit to you that they do n't have the benefit of being able to of of letting allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O D O O O O O O O O O
1485	it 's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1486	and they are very effective too	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1487	that the	NONE	NONE	O O
1488	i have been involved just slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1489	but his attorneys gotten him off	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
1490	the city has dropped their charges against him because their the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O

1756	in most states as long as you are n't a convicted felon or on probation or other obvious things like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1757	and i know i know that in a lot of states you could you could be just released from a mental hospital the day before be be obviously insane	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O

1772	the the	NONE	NONE	D O
1773	in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the united states	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O

1818	that 's why i ended up giving it back to him	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O

2091	i just i guess	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2092	i would be curious to know what you thought as to how c n n t v news compared to the three networks whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2093	but i i guess you would n't	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O
2094	you probably	NONE	NONE	O O
2095	if you just watched it during the gulf war that probably would n't would n't tell you much	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O
2096	during that small sample i would think that everyone was just about just about the same except the three networks radio television programming	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O
2097	so if at a particular time you wanted to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by turning on c n n	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2098	and you	NONE	NONE	O O
2099	are you married	NONE	NONE	O O O

2102	and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2103	we do	NONE	NONE	O O
2104	basically there 's the the expenses that are fixed during the month the ones that come every every month	NONE	NONE	O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O
2105	and we enter those into into a spread sheet	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O O
2106	and whatever is left after that we we sit down and agree on kind of what what sort of range we are going to generally going to shoot for	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O D D O O O O O
2107	i see	NONE	NONE	O O
2108	what do you do	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2109	that 's basically what we do	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2110	about every every three months or so we re-evaluate our budget	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O
2111	and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2112	and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
2113	i work part time at night	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2114	and he works and my husband works full times days	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O
2115	and so we have four checks	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2116	but that works out nice because we get paid every week	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
2117	and so that does help	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2118	that helps a lot	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2119	and then we do n't have a lot extra for extra spending	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
2120	so it 's pretty well ear marked	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
2121	all allocated out	NONE	NONE	O O O
2122	every penny is ear marked	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2123	but it we have found that works the best	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O
2124	and and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O D D O O O O O
2125	in fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2126	but and divide those up between all	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O
2127	all the checks	NONE	NONE	O O O
2128	and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O D O O O
2129	and then the next pay check we 're real short	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
2130	we found that it 's definitely helped get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2131	that 's true	NONE	NONE	O O O
2132	we were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were spending money for things that	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2133	we kind of tended to eat out a bit more than we should have	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2134	and it was easy to let things get out of hand	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
2135	we thought it thought it to be really helpful	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O
2136	we have gotten some of our loans paid off really because of this and stuff like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2137	it helps you to focus where your money goes	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2138	and and i am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O
2139	but you 're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O
2140	and then you 're saying where did all that money go	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
2141	that 's a lot of money	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2142	where does it go	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2143	and also we have found that if we write down	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
2144	and we did this	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2145	we are not real consistent with this	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
2146	but we did it for about a month	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
2147	and we wrote down everything that we bought when every pay check	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D O O O
2148	and so we could see where every penny went	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2149	and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
2150	and like i say we have n't been real consistent with it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
2151	it 's	NONE	NONE	O O
2152	we should cause it does help	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2153	the other the other thing that that we 've found that helps is we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit	NONE	NONE	D D O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2154	it 's just to get up the money in advance and put it in so long as it was n't unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or whatever just put it in in an envelope or whatever	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O
2155	and that way it kind of forced us to stick to that amount and then once that was gone if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say it 's gone	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2156	just stick to that	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2157	that is	NONE	NONE	O O
2158	that that sounds like a really good idea	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O
2159	and it really helpful	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2160	have you developed a savings plan or i r a s or anything like that yet	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

2277	and they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2278	i did n't think that was a new revelation	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2279	it 's not too new	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2280	what what is the e p a recommending now	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O
2281	they really did n't propose any solutions	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
2282	actually they were the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the e p a	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2283	but he had a lot of facts to to give and things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2284	and and one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of of news print	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O
2285	he was talking about the city of new york and how they went and collected all this news print	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2286	and they could sell it for a while	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
2287	they were able to sell it for some amount per ton	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
2288	and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling they 've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2289	that 's a that 's a common problem though	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O
2290	that it seems that has happened in dallas as well as new york	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O
2291	and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2292	and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i could n't recycle it anymore which is n't good for business on the other end either i suppose	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2293	we 're doing some here in in cash valley the community here	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D O O O O O O
2294	there 's we 've actually got a kind of a nice set up	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O O O O O
2295	we 've got a couple of plants here that actually take recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it 's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2296	and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2297	that 's good	NONE	NONE	O O O
2298	so one of the real keys it like to getting recycling for paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2299	there has to be a reuse for it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
2300	that 's why they recycle	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2301	the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers everything from waste baskets to carpet to the no stick the sticky slide rugs under the carpet	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D O O O O O O O
2302	and i think they are even putting it in the roadways these days	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2303	and they 're making clothes now that are recycled	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2304	like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O O O O O O
2305	and there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from alabama	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2306	and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2307	one was environmental protection	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2308	and the other one was i ca n't remember what	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
2309	but the basic idea it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2310	and the solution that he came up with for plastics and it was really quite amazing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O
2311	he says the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2312	he came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it 's it 's low weight but it 's high volume so it takes up a lot of space	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2313	and there 's almost no energy there 's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling	NONE	NONE	O D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2314	but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2315	so his solution was to burn plastic collect it and burn it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
2316	it 's carbon	NONE	NONE	O O O
2317	so that makes sense	NONE	NONE	O O O O

2476	so we are able to have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2477	and then there are there 's a deposit program on plastic and glass containers primarily soft drink bottles	NONE	NONE	O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2478	and so we are able to take it to one of the rehabilitation centers	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2479	and then they recycle the containers	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2480	they refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2481	and then	NONE	NONE	O O
2482	the the deposit 's only on drink stuff	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O
2483	on the on primarily on soft drink pops and that kind of thing	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O

2487	so it 's fairly fairly extensive	NONE	NONE	O O O D O O
2488	but then again it 's it 's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city	NONE	NONE	O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2489	did they	NONE	NONE	O O
2490	you 're giving are you giving these products to the handicapped group	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O

2492	or or are you or are they some home distributing the funds back to you	NONE	NONE	D D D D O O D O O O O O O O O
2493	actually there 's there 's the opportunity for both	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O
2494	generally the the handicapped group takes care of the things that	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O
2495	actually the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to recycle the bottle so that you get your money back	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2496	and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2497	and then i and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O
2498	that 's very cool	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2499	there 's a i heard about a similar program in new york city where a thing called homeless incorporated or something like that	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2500	but what they do is employ homeless i mostly men but homeless people to go out and collect all the recyclable cans	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2501	and and i think it 's mostly cans	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O
2502	there may be bottles as well but beer cans soda cans and what not	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2503	and they bring them up to a one one centralized location and are able to collect the money from the various beer and and soda manufacturers and and get more money to these people that desperately need it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O
2504	i guess partly because of our climate	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
2505	here in saskatoon at least the majority of central	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2506	i want to say central canada	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2507	but central canada tends to referred more to ontario and quebec	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
2508	but we do n't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2509	we certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2510	there 's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although scouts and hockey teams and ball teams those kinds regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2511	do they do it with news papers as well	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2512	they have done it some	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2513	but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
2514	they are actually at virtually all of the shopping centers the shopping malls	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2515	there are several containers where the group called cosmopolitan industries collects	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O

2517	and then the bins are collected	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2518	some of the	NONE	NONE	O O O
2519	the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying to put together a long term financial plan and monthly budget	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2520	the only thing i do now is put the data into quicken	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
2521	i do n't know if you are familiar with that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
2522	i have some friends of mine who use quicken	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2523	and i 've considered using it once myself	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
2524	but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2525	so i i kind of gave up on the idea of using quicken at least for now	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2526	i 've found it 's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then not bother to total it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2527	and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
2528	so it really helps with that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2529	it 's similar problems	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2530	but we just have the one check book	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
2531	and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2532	and occasionally we will get behind like you say	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2533	but it does n't really seem to be too too tight if we just remember to keep everything up up to date and balanced	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O
2534	how to you handle that the long range or medium range planning on finances	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2535	actually we have n't had to until just recently	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2536	i guess we 've got a a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O
2537	so we needed to start doing more of that just for saving for college and things like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2538	we tried a way try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that	NONE	NONE	O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2539	that 's pretty good if you can do that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2540	i know	NONE	NONE	O O
2541	i have a daughter who 's ten	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
2542	and we have n't really put much away for her college up to this point	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2543	but we 're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2544	so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2545	and then the money that i will be making this summer we 'll be putting away for the college fund	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2546	sounds good	NONE	NONE	O O
2547	i guess we 're we 're just at the point my wife worked until we had a family	NONE	NONE	O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2548	and then now we 're just going on the one income	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
2549	so it 's a lot more interesting trying to	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2550	find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to do it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2551	kind of enforce the savings	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2552	but it will be interesting to see	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
2553	our situation is just a little bit kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently took on a full time job almost full time	NONE	NONE	O O O O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2554	so it 's only recently that we 've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2555	that sounds good	NONE	NONE	O O O

2557	how about you	NONE	NONE	O O O

2667	what do you think about putting the elderly in a nursing home	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
2668	i think that it it varies on on the individual basis	NONE	NONE	O O O D O O D O O O O
2669	sometimes it is there is no alternative	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O
2670	you do not have family available or family that 's	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
2671	you may not even have family that is in who are around	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D D D O O O
2672	that 's true	NONE	NONE	O O O
2673	so sometimes it 's not an alternative	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
2674	and i think but i think also sometimes it can be a benefit if it 's for a short time	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2675	sometimes in a nursing home	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2676	especially if if it 's after an acute illness	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O
2677	to get over a	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2678	or to rehab after an illness	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2679	that 's true	NONE	NONE	O O O
2680	i never thought of that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2681	sometimes sometimes the nursing homes are good for just short periods of time	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O
2682	that 's true	NONE	NONE	O O O
2683	until they get over that hump of whatever it is they 're dealing with	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2684	because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them out much faster than what they 're really able to	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2685	they really are	NONE	NONE	O O O
2686	they do n't like to keep them longer than a week	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
2687	so so there is some good to it	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O
2688	sometimes too it 's used as a dumb job	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2689	the the families do not necessarily know what to do with them	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O
2690	what do you mean	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2691	and they do n't want to take the responsibility	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2692	so they will put them in a nursing home	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2693	that 's true	NONE	NONE	O O O
2694	so you there 's both sides to it too	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2695	what do you think	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2696	and it depends on how how sick the person is too what you 're capable of if you have a family to take care of of your own	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2697	i would personally like it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2698	if my parents were to get ill i would like to take care of them at home and i had the money with some help	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2699	that 's not always possible	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2700	that 's true	NONE	NONE	O O O
2701	but to the best of my ability i 'd like to do it until it gets impossible	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2702	i think that 's also where you 're going to have a lot of people who are going to	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2703	it 's there 's not a choice it 's because it 's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2704	so that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the either medicare or insurance to cover it	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O
2705	that 's true	NONE	NONE	O O O
2706	but i think nursing homes can be good	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
2707	it just depends on what kind they are	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
2708	you need to check them out ahead of time	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2709	and then there 's also some that are set up for specialties	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
2710	i know some	NONE	NONE	O O O
2711	unfortunately some elderly have to go to or have i it 's alzheimer 's or where they wonder or or confused or have some mental problem	NONE	NONE	O O O D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O
2712	that they 're	NONE	NONE	O O O
2713	and you need a special nursing home for that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2714	you need one that has a unit that 's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2715	and you need people who are trained for that type of problem	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
2716	who know what they 're doing with that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
2717	so so there 's different types of nursing homes i think	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O
2718	my grandmother 's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2719	and she really liked the idea of of moving there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O O
2720	she 's not ill yet	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
2721	but she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
2722	and then she decided that she 's eighty five years old that eventually she she does n't want her family taking care of her and being a burden	NONE	NONE	O O O O D O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2723	she 's very independent	NONE	NONE	O O O O
2724	so she 's in this nursing home	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
2725	it 's out in the country	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
2726	and she really enjoys it right now because she does n't have to wash dishes or cook	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2727	gives her a little bit of her own independence	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
2728	but she still has a security there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
2729	some support	NONE	NONE	O O
2730	and then there 's also sort of a wing for those people that do get sick	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2731	and what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2732	and then so if she ever does become ill it will be like family around her	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2733	that 's right	NONE	NONE	O O O
2734	and i i 've seen some of them like that too	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O
2735	and also they have a lot of activities going on for the ones who are more active	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

2737	she loves it	NONE	NONE	O O O
2738	she has a great social life	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O

2742	and i i hope that i have something like that when i get older	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O
2743	i i think i think the i think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the elderly person who 's going in and the family that 's going to be effected by it	NONE	NONE	D D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2744	definitely it 's	NONE	NONE	O O O
2745	and sometimes it can those those choices can be made in advance	NONE	NONE	O O D D D O O O O O O O

3451	we pay in a substantial amount	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3452	we do n't regret paying taxes	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3453	we do think that sometimes we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3454	and progressive tax i does not give people incentive to make more money	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3455	and what i mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

3464	is n't	NONE	NONE	O O

3471	there was that	NONE	NONE	O O O
3472	was it jerry brown	NONE	NONE	O O O O
3473	one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the the tax codes they have now and implementing a i a flat percentage something like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O
3474	if you implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people to make more money	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3475	and the what people need to understand in my opinion this just my opinion is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3476	and so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here 's my break point i 'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

3479	based on that who do you think you 're talking to	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
3480	you 're talking to an employer	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3481	up until eighty-five or something was the	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
3482	with the issue of trial by jury i actually found the whole question about whether you need a a a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O
3483	actually i i agree that that 's an interesting thing	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O
3484	i i believe that 's a for for civil suits it 's not unanimous	NONE	NONE	D O O D D D D O O O O O O O
3485	but for for criminal suits it 's unanimous by federal law	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O
3486	i do n't know if it 's even true that it 's always unanimous because i thought there were cases where i do n't if it 's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors but where it was okay for a state to have it eleven out of twelve	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3487	i actually thought i 'd read that too	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
3488	and that 's why i phrased it that way	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
3489	i wonder	NONE	NONE	O O
3490	the difference the difference could be that for state there is such a thing state felonies versus federal felonies that federal things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O
3491	and things that are under state jurisdiction even criminal do n't require	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O
3492	but i do n't know what the the laws	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O D O O
3493	do you think that that 's an unreasonable requirement that they be unanimous	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3494	i 'd be curious as to what the requirement for a an acquittal is	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D O O O
3495	and i i do n't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if six or seven voted not guilty then instead of it being a hung jury that was an acquittal	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3496	but i do n't know whether you need an a unanimous vote of not guilty to acquit	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O
3497	that that would be an interesting change	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O
3498	it was also allow the idea that if you had one person who was very disagreeable that it it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because the fact that it 's the the principle is that the fact that it 's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt criterion that it increases the the likelihood of getting the proper judgment	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O D D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O
3499	so i i think if anything it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3500	i 'd agree with that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3501	but i 've never had the the opportunity to serve on a jury although i 've been out here and registered for i about five years	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3502	actually i i thought that that would be very interesting thing to do	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O
3503	i would like to do that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3504	i 've been out here twenty some years	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
3505	and i 've been called three different times	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
3506	but i 've never actually even made it into the the jury box and because there have always been a number of people	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O D O O O D O O O O O O O O O
3507	and and i 've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3508	i also think that would be really good	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
3509	the people i know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that after initially finding out where people stand that the whole deliberation usually results if there is a something like a nine three or or more severe and and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they 're right	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O D O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3510	and in fact i 'm not sure that that 's any more liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than than anything else	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O
3511	the the one thing that i know does seem to happen from people i 've talked to on this is that in the situation you just said where it 's nine to three or some such number that there 's an effect starts being that there 's starts being a lot of peer pressure going on	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O
3512	and that that peer pressure	NONE	NONE	O D O O O
3513	and in some cases if it 's a long trial the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3514	i 'd read one book i it was calls trial by jury of all things that went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases and in many cases looking at what had at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right went back to the jurors based on the deliberations	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3515	some of them did say that when they were the only one left opposing the verdict everyone was getting on them so so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote does n't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

3723	it 's that 's no problem here	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O
3724	we really liked it up there	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3725	but then	NONE	NONE	O O
3726	do you ever think that there 's a crime that 's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just does n't deserve to live anymore	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3727	that 's a good question	NONE	NONE	O O O O O

3729	but since i 've become a parent and since i 've seen things like jeffrey dahlmer i really have to question that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3730	i really i i ca n't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3731	and try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
3732	of the statements made by people against the the death penalty i i like the statement made by cuomo	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O D O O O D O O O O O O O
3733	cuomo i is	NONE	NONE	O O O
3734	he 's he 's governor of new york	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O
3735	but he 's against the death penalty	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
3736	but he said that he would he would want to to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if if they did something to his wife	NONE	NONE	O O O O D D O O O D O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O
3737	and that 's	NONE	NONE	O O O
3738	but but even even in that in that situation he would he would hope that there would be people around him who would keep him from doing the doing the things	NONE	NONE	D O D O D D O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O
3739	it 's a it 's a question of your your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O
3740	and that was the thing that killed dukakis back four years ago when someone asked him a similar question	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3741	and he he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion a gut level reaction	NONE	NONE	O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O
3742	and i think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level whether it be a biblical force the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a knife life type logic or just some sort of anger at putting putting murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life while we foot the bill	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3743	i think people are are working at that from more of a a gut reaction than a a reason humane one	NONE	NONE	O O O D O O O O O O O D O O O O D O O O O
3744	i do n't think the decisions that are going to be made on on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3745	are they reformatories where we 're trying to take people who ca n't survive or or that that are n't conforming enough to society so that that we work well together	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O D O O O O O O O O D O O O O O
3746	or are they	NONE	NONE	O O O
3747	is it a penal institution	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3748	is it is is it designed for punishment	NONE	NONE	D D D O O O O O
3749	the death penalty surely fits in well with in a penal situation where you 're trying to punishment	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O
3750	perhaps not in the manner that we do it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
3751	but but it in in theory it fits in	NONE	NONE	D O D D O O O O O
3752	in system in a reformatory	NONE	NONE	D D O O O
3753	if you if you put someone to death you obviously ca n't reform them	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O O O O O O
3754	that 's true	NONE	NONE	O O O
3755	the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
3756	and i really do n't agree with that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
3757	i do n't think anyone who would commit a a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say i was about to kill and dismember this person	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3758	but if they catch me they 're going to kill me	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O
3759	so i better not do it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O
3760	i i just do n't think that that it works that way	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O D O O O O O
3761	i do n't think it 's done	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O
3762	i do n't think we run it as a deterrent	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
3763	people say that	NONE	NONE	O O O
3764	but if it was really a deterrent i think like horse thieves in the old west they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3765	and if we really if it was really seriously going to be a deterrent i would think that it would be public	NONE	NONE	O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3766	i do n't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever nobody ever sees it	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O
3767	if someone ever	NONE	NONE	O O O
3768	like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime had to sit and watch and and see a guy burn or or something or shot by a firing squad or something like that	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O
3769	i would think you 'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than telling them that there 's there 's protestors out here at the	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O
3770	i i do n't know if that would really work that way or not	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3771	there 's a lot of violence	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O

3783	the the jury that 's trying the officers in that case is is an all white panel	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O O O D O O O O O

3791	it 's in ventura	NONE	NONE	O O O O
3792	and there 's there 's still quite a bit of publicity obviously	NONE	NONE	O D D O O O O O O O O O
3793	and it 's kind of it 's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that that	NONE	NONE	O D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O
3794	that videotape was just horrible	NONE	NONE	O O O O O
3795	it was everywhere	NONE	NONE	O O O

3797	i agree with you	NONE	NONE	O O O O
3798	but i ca n't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of of discrimination or or appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O D O O D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3799	i i 'm kind of torn on this issue	NONE	NONE	D O O O O O O O O
3800	it 's like they 're saying on the one hand they 're not he 's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i true	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3801	but on the other hand it 's it 's also saying that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict	NONE	NONE	O O O O O D D O O O O O O O D D D D O O O O O
3802	they 're not going to do their job which is	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O
3803	the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there 's enough	NONE	NONE	D D O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O
3804	based on fact	NONE	NONE	O O O

3812	that ca n't be good for los angeles either	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O
3813	on on on one hand on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it 's they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy	NONE	NONE	D D D D D O O O O O O O O O O O O D D O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3814	unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like los angeles	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

3834	to get that judge recalled i would think	NONE	NONE	O O O O O O O O
